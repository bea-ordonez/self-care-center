### Learning Goals:
The learning goals included working with HTML and Javascript. I also gained experience using CSS. I was able to put into practice a lot of what I have learned. 

### Wins + Challenges:
It was a win to complete this project with little help, I am very proud of what I have accomplished! It was fun to style and very exciting when things worked like I expected! It was a challenge to get the background gradient just right, I used a google a lot and kept trying things until I got it to work. It was also a challenge to move things around to get them exactly where I wanted them, trial and error worked well here too. When I was working on the function to delete a checked favorite, I was able to delete them but then realized that the index position was increasing as I took one message out and I thought I fixed it by using i-- to decrement the index position , however, it still didn't work correctly because it is not updating the element's ID. I was not able to find a solution for this.
